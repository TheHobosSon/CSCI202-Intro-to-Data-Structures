# CSCI202-Intro-to-Data-Structures

This is a compilation of most of my work from my Intro to Data Structures course that I took at UNC Asheville. Any file that has the author listed as ksanft was written by my professor and provided for use in a given assignment. If the author is not listed it was written by me. If there are multiple authors listed the assignment was written cooperatively. All programs are to be launched from their respective Main.java file. This is merely a showcase of the work I did and therefore does not show all of my work.
